# Zaza.io — Childcare Management Platform

> **"Zaza"** means *child* in Malagasy.

Zaza.io is a multi-tenant childcare SaaS platform built for French-speaking Africa and Madagascar. It enables daycare schools to manage children, daily activities, parent communication, and attendance — all in one place.

---

## Features

- **Multi-tenant architecture** — shared schema with `school_id` FK isolation on every model; no schema-per-tenant complexity
- **Role-based access control** — three roles: `Director`, `Teacher`, `Parent`, each with scoped permissions
- **Activity feed** — log CHECKIN, CHECKOUT, MEAL, NAP, NOTE, PHOTO events per child
- **Child management** — children grouped by pedagogical level (Garderie / TPS / PS / MS / GS), with allergy tracking
- **Contacts & authorized pickups** — per-child contacts with relation types, emergency flag, and pickup authorization
- **Parent access** — a parent account can span multiple schools via `ChildParent` pivot
- **Messaging** — per-child `Thread` with typed `Message` (text, image, file)
- **i18n** — French, English, and Malagasy (gettext + django-modeltranslation)
- **JWT authentication** — email-based login, no username

## Data Model

```
School           ── the tenant (slug, name)
User             ── AbstractUser with role: Director / Teacher / Parent
Group            ── pedagogical level (Garderie / TPS / PS / MS / GS)
Child            ── belongs to one School + one Group, has allergies[]
ChildParent      ── pivot: Child ↔ Parent (multi-school parent account)
ChildContact     ── authorized pickup / emergency contact (not a User)
Activity         ── CHECKIN | CHECKOUT | MEAL | NAP | NOTE | PHOTO
Thread           ── one per child, messaging entry point
Message          ── TEXT | IMAGE | FILE inside a Thread
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/zaza.git
cd zaza

# Start PostgreSQL, Redis, and the Django dev server
docker compose up --build

# In a second terminal — run migrations and create a superuser
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

The API is available at `http://localhost:8000/`.

### Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values (DB credentials, secret key, etc.). The `dev.py` settings read from environment variables or fall back to the Docker Compose defaults.
